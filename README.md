This is a pytorch implementation of <a href="https://github.com/aryanmikaeili/Pointnet">Pointent</a> model.

It can reach 88.37% accuracy for Modelnet40 classification task after 250 epochs of training. 

Parameters of the model (number of points used for training, regularization constant, learning rate adjustment schedule and etc) are exactly the same as the parameters mentioned in the paper.
